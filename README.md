For Kaggle contest: Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification

## What's here so far?

For the time being, I'm developing a data exploration 
kernel in a Jupyter notebook. The first chunk is there as 
of Tuesday, December 26, but there is much more to do.

## What's next?

I plan to finish the kernel hopefully tomorrow, at least as
a first pass. Afterword I will start developing a multi-
label classifier. There are some clear baselines already
established in the Kaggle community, so I will begin 
from those and presumably create an ensemble model of 
some sort.

## Who am I? 

I'm a Graduate student and Data Science Initiative affiliate
at UC Davis. I'm played with some kaggle datasets before
and used one competition as a project for a statistics 
course, but this is my first real structured attempt to
compete. Ultimately, I hope to learn a lot and not finish
in last place :P.
