# toxic_comments
For Kaggle contest: Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification

## What's here so far?

There is an exploratory analysis kernel in jupyter notebook format found in 'Summary.ipynb'. The summary focuses on
correlations between the types of comment labels, missing / weird data, and most common terms in toxic comments.

## What's next?

I will start developing a multi-label classifier for different sorts of toxic comments. There are some clear 
baselines already established in the Kaggle community, so I will begin from those and presumably create an 
ensemble model of some sort. More details to come.

## Who am I? 

I am a Graduate student and Data Science Initiative affiliate at UC Davis. I have played with some kaggle datasets 
before and used one competition as a project for a statistics course, but this is my first real structured attempt 
to compete. Ultimately, I hope to learn a lot and not finish in last place :P.
